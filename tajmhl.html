        <h1>About Taj mahal </h1>
        <p>Located on the southern bank of the Yamuna River, Taj Mahal rises like a dream from the hazy, and oftentimes
            chaotic city of Agra. Completed in the year 1653, the entire Taj complex is not only a testament to the
            beauty and genius of artisans of the bygone era, but is also known to carry a legacy with it.
            <br>
            The complex was a witness to 130 years of Mughal reign. If you want to step back in history and take a peek
            inside what that era looked like, go for a stroll inside the complex. From the magnificent Mughal
            architecture to cuisines sold outside the complex, everything has been inspired by the memorable era of the
            Mughals.
            <br>
            Needless to say, you should start your exploration of the city with the Taj Mahal. It is always recommended
            to visit this beautiful mausoleum early in the morning; the view of the sunrise is worth every effort. The
            complex opens even before the sun comes up, so you can start your tour at the earliest (to avoid the crowd
            later in the day). It is also one of the most beautiful places to visit in Agra at night.
