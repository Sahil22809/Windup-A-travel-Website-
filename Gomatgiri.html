        <h1>About  Gomatgiri </h1>
        <p>
            A sacred place for the devotees of the Jain community, Gomatgiri has 24 temples dedicated to each of the 24 Thirthankars revered by the Jains. Located atop a hill, the place attracts tourists and devotees alike. One of the key attractions here is the gigantic 21-feet statue of Gomateshwar. Make sure that you visit the place during the evening hours as the view of the setting sun from the hilltop is an amazing sight to behold.
