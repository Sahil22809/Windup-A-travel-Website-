        <h1>About Upper Lake</h1>
        <p>Upper Lake is the most important lake of Bhopal which is commonly known as Bhojtal. It is located near CM
            House, Bhopal, and is the oldest man-made lake in the country. The lake was named after Raja Bhoj, who built
            the lake across the Kolan River in the 11th century. The lake is now a major source of drinking water for
            the city's residents. On the eastern shore of the lake, some water sports for the visitors like parasailing,
            kayaking, canoeing, rafting, etc., offers exciting water sports. The best time to visit is early morning or
            late evening when you can take a leisurely stroll along the way.</p>
