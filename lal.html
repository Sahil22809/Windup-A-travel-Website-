        <h1>About Lal Bagh Palace </h1>
        <p>Lal Bagh Palace, which was once the residence of the Holkar rulers of Indore, exemplifies opulence and grandeur. Currently, the palace serves as a museum that displays a range of interesting artifacts. A walk through the palace will allow you to soak in the richness of the structure. Its Italian marble floors, dazzling chandeliers, elaborate paintings, all speak volumes about the incredible lifestyle of the royal residents who had once called this palace their home. An interesting feature of the palace is its main gate, which is a replica of the gates of Buckingham Palace in London.  </p>
