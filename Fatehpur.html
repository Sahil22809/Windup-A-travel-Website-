        <h1>About Fatehpur Sikri </h1>
        <p>No trip to Agra is complete without a visit to the ancient walled city of Fatehpur Sikri. Located at a
            distance of around 40 km from Agra, it is famed as the political capital of Emperor Akbar and is one of the
            top places to visit in Agra.
            <br>
            By visiting Fatehpur Sikri, one goes further back in time to take a look at the reign of Akbar. Just like
            Agra Fort, Fatehpur Sikri Fort is also listed among the World Heritage Sites by UNESCO.
            <br>
            Akbar first went to Sikri to meet a Sufi saint by the name of Shaikh Salim Chishti. He prophesied about the
            heir to the Mughal throne and after the prophecy came true, Akbar decided to move his capital to Sikri.
            <br>
            Just like Akbar’s secular beliefs and his idea to take in the positivity from different cultures and
            religions, the fort also displays the same ethos. A blend of Persian and Mughal architecture with some
            glimpses of Hindu, Christian and Jain culture as well, take your time to explore each structure inside the
            complex.
            <br>
            The establishment has a beautiful mosque along with three palaces, one for each of his wife. Some of the
            important structures you should not miss are Jodha Bai’s Palace, Panch Mahal and Hiran Minar.
