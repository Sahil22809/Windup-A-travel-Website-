    <p>Raisen Fort is situated on the top of a hill on the north-west corner of Gondwana. The fort is 800 years old with a huge stone wall with nine gates. Raisen Fort was built in the 11th century. The ancient fort also houses a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva and the shrine of Muslim saint Hazrat Pir Fatehullah Shah.
