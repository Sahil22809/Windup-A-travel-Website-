        <h1>About Balancing rock  </h1>
        <p>A miraculous wonder of nature, the Balancing Rock formations in Jabalpur are actually an offshoot of eroded volcanic rocks. The upper rock is balanced on the lower rock in a way that no natural disaster has been able to disrupt their original standing. In fact, this huge independent rock has sustained the impact of an earthquake that measured as high as 6.5 on the Richter Scale. The unusual topography at the site has made it a popular attraction among locals and tourists.  </p>
