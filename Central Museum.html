        <p>
            Central Museum, also known as the Indore Museum, is a treasure trove of artifacts and relics belonging to
            the bygone eras. Some of these artifacts even date back to the pre-historic ages. Established in 1929, it
            counts among the three main museums in Indore. Among the major exhibits of this museum are stone sculptures,
            coins, scriptures, arms and armors, and other historical relics. The museum boasts of a few canons that were
            used by Mughal emperors like Babar, Humayun, and Jehangir.
