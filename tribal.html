        <h1>About Tribal Museum</h1>
        <p>Situated in Shyamala Hills in Bhopal, Tribal Museum is one of the best places to visit in Bhopal. The Tribal Museum was inaugurated by former President Pranab Mukherjee in 2013 and has been designed by Revati Kamath. The museum is divided into 6 colorful galleries showcasing the diversity of the seven tribes of the state which include Gond, Sahariya, Bharia, Kol, Baiga, Korku and Bhil. <br>
            The museum displays the art, customs, culture, paintings, artifacts and practices of the tribes. The purpose of the museum is only to spread awareness among the general public about the tribal culture and life.
