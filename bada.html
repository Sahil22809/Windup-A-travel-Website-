        <h1>About  Bada Ganpati </h1>
        <p>he famous temple of Bada Ganpati was built during the rule of Queen Ahilya Bai Holkar. The main attraction of the temple is the huge 25-feet idol of Lord Ganesha, which is among the largest statues of the deity in the world. Plan a visit to the temple even if you are not a devotee, just to get a glimpse of the gigantic statue made using an interesting mix of materials such as jaggery, bricks, limestone, and soil from several holy places across the country.
