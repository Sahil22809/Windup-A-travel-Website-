                <p>Chausath Yogini Temple, built in the 10th century by the Kalachuris, is one of the oldest heritage sites in the country.

Although in ruins, this shrine – which can be reached by climbing 150-something steps  </p>

            <h2> About Marble Rocks</h2>
            <p>Perhaps the best thing you will see in Jabalpur is the peculiar Marble Rocks along the Narmada River.
                Rising up to a height of 100 feet, these mountains of marble appear in different forms and colours –
                including white, black, light blue and light green – as you travel across the gorge in a cable car or on
                a row boat. Soak in the picturesque views here, especially during the sunset or on a full moon night,
                for a mystical experience that will be etched in your memory forever.</p>

            <h2> About Dhuandhar Falls</h2>
            <p> A short drive from the city will take you to Dhuandhar Falls, plunging beautifully from a height of 98
                feet. The tremendous force with which the waters of Narmada cascade down the rocky surface lends the
                fall its name (meaning ‘smoke flow’), and makes for a mesmerising view. The best part is you can enjoy
                the extraordinary splendour of this waterfall at any time of the year. Go here for a boat ride, a picnic
                on the riverside, or for the most amazing views of the sunset.</p>
