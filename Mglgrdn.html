        <h1>About Mughal Gardens </h1>
        <p>After taking a tour of the minarets, tombs and the entire monument, you can sit at the Mughal Garden or just take a stroll along it. A reflection of the concept of ‘Paradise Garden’, the idea of Charbagh or a Mughal Garden around the Taj was inspired by the Persian gardens. It not only enhances the beauty of the entire complex but has a long avenue of trees laid out according to their scientific names. The fountain in the middle of the garden reflects Taj Mahal on full moon nights, making it an even surreal sight than it already is. Mughal Gardens is one of the most beautiful places to visit in Agra in evening.
