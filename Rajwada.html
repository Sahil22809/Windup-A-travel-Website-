        <h1>About Rajwada Palace </h1>
        <p>The magnificent Rajwada Palace was built by the rulers of the Holkar Dynasty about two centuries ago. It is a seven-storied structure that exemplifies grandeur and architectural craftsmanship. Replete with landscaped gardens and fountains, this palace presents a sight to behold. Built in the Maratha, French, and Mughal architectural styles, this grand palace exhibits ornamented jharokas, lofty archways, elaborate wooden jalis, and splendid chattries. It is definitely one of the best places to visit in Indore. The light and sound show held here every evening is a key attraction for tourists, so plan your visit accordingly.   </p>
