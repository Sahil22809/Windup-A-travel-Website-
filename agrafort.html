        <h1>About Agra fort </h1>
        <p>No Agra itinerary is complete without visiting the magnificently stunning Agra Fort. Touted as one of the
            finest Mughal forts in Agra, this one is often underrated by both tourists and tour guides.
            <br>
            Among the places to visit in Agra in 2 days, Agra Fort shares a close second spot next to the famous Taj
            Mahal. So, for your second day, we recommend taking in the red sandstone beauty of this fort along with
            exploring places close by. Start with the Agra Fort. Just keep walking through the long courtyards of this
            huge fort and you will realize what a magnanimous structure it indeed is.
            <br>
            The fort was the grand plan of Emperor Akbar, who wanted this to be the military base of the Mughal Empire.
            And the fort did serve its purposes. However, when Shah Jahan came in power, he modified the structure a bit
            by making some additions with his favorite material – white marble.
            <br>
            A palace and a fortress, this structure has hidden legacies, myths and many corridors that intrigue
            visitors. From Diwan-I-Am to Sheesh Mahal, you can spend an entire day just soaking up the beauty of this.
